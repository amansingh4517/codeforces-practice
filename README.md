# Codeforces Practice Solutions

A collection of my Codeforces problem solutions implemented in Java, organized by difficulty rating.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Solutions are organized into folders based on their Codeforces difficulty rating (e.g., 800, 900, 1000, 1100, etc.).

Each folder contains:
- Java solution files
- A README.md with a table linking problems to their Codeforces pages and solution files

## 📊 Progress Tracking

| Rating | Problems Solved |
|--------|----------------|
| 800    | 3              |
| 900    | 1              |
| **Total** | **4**      |

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as:
- A personal archive of solved Codeforces problems
- A reference for problem-solving approaches and algorithms
- Practice material for competitive programming

## 📝 How to Navigate

1. Browse folders by difficulty rating
2. Check each folder's README.md for a complete list of problems
3. Each problem entry includes:
   - Problem name
   - Direct link to the Codeforces problem
   - Link to the solution file

## 🚀 Running Solutions

All solutions are written in Java. To run a solution:

```bash
javac <filename>.java
java <classname>
```
